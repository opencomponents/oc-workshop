# Create an OC for your business card

* Create a new component named `bc-(username)` where username is the first letter of your name + your last name, example `bc-mfigus`.
* The component's markup needs to contain your name, your linked e-mail address, and your avatar. The static resources need to be incapsulated as static resources in the component. Structure the markup as you like.
* The style needs to be inside a `<style>` tag inside the component's markup and needs to contain 2 skins: black (dark background and white text) and white (white background and dark text). Be creative with the CSS as you like.
* An optional parameter `skin` (`white`|`dark`, default `white`) should allow the to view the component with the appropriate css skin.
* The component should be published to `http://oc-registry.herokuapp.com` under the name `bc-(username)` where username is the first letter of your name and your last name, example `bc-mfigus`.
* Well done! [Part II](2.md)
