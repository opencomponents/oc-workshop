# Consume an API on the server

* Create a new component called city-weather
* On the server, use `require` module to make a call to `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk` passing the City descriptor as a parameter. Ask for the Api key.
* On the front-end, when the city is not found show an error message; when the city is found show an icon and the temperature. For the icon, use the online images available here: http://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions.
* Publish the component.
* Now nest the city-weather component on your business card component, given the city you are from, using oc.build and oc.renderUnloadedComponents functionalities.
* If you made it until here this is great!
